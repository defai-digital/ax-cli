Use this page to find the right guide for your scenario. All links below point to up-to-date docs that reflect the current provider split (ax-glm for Z.AI, ax-grok for xAI Grok, ax-cli for local/offline).

- Quickstart
  - `docs/installation.md` — Install and set up by provider (GLM, Grok, local/offline). Includes platform and Node requirements.
  - `docs/usage.md` — Interactive vs headless examples, per-provider flags, and environment overrides.
- Reference
  - `docs/cli-reference.md` — Command flags, env vars, tool round limits, thinking/reasoning switches.
  - `docs/configuration.md` — Config files, precedence, and keys for user/project scopes.
- Guides
  - `docs/features.md` — What the CLI actually supports today (providers, models, tooling, security).
  - `docs/glm-4.6-usage-guide.md` — How to use GLM-4.6/4.6V features (thinking, vision), with safe defaults.
  - `docs/multi-provider-guide.md` — Running ax-glm and ax-grok side-by-side with isolated state.
- Operations / Troubleshooting
  - `docs/troubleshooting.md` — Common errors and verification steps.
  - `docs/migration-guides/` — Version-specific changes; use only for the listed versions.

Legacy or deprecated docs (to be consulted only for history):
- `docs/usage-tracking-*`, `docs/figma-guide.md`, older migration summaries.

If a document you expect is missing, start from this index and prefer the “Quickstart” and “Reference” entries—they are kept in sync with the CLI defaults and provider configs.***
